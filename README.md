Customer Segmentation project
Context
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a dataset of customers into groups of similar
customers based on certain common characteristics, usually for the purpose of understanding the
population dataset in a better fashion. Understanding customer behavior and characteristics is
usually a critical part of the marketing operations of any business or organization, with direct
consequences on sales & marketing strategy. Customer segmentation is often viewed as a means to
achieve a better return on investment from marketing efforts, and make organizations more efficient
in terms of utilizing their money, time, and other critical resources in custom marketing strategies for
different groups of customers based on their unique needs and motivations.
For example, it has been understood from various research that customer segmentation often has a
huge impact on people’s email engagement. Segmented campaigns often see over 100% more
clicks than non-segmented campaigns, and email marketers who have segmented their audience
before campaigning have reported a 6-7 times growth in their overall revenue. It has also been
observed in various contexts that in today’s world, individual customers prefer personalized
communications and offerings that cater to their particular interests.
In the context of marketing analytics then, customer segmentation has a vital role to play in
optimizing ROI. It typically involves analyzing metrics around customer engagement with various
marketing activities including but not limited to, ATL (above the line) marketing activities, BTL (below
the line) campaigns, and targeting personalized offers. Typically, the variables of interest are
customer profiles, campaign conversion rates, and information associated with various marketing
channels. Based on these feature categories, the target is to create the best possible customer
segments from the given data.
